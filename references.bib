  abstract = "Summary 1. Riparian vegetation composition, structure and
              abundance are governed to a large degree by river flow regime and
              flow-mediated fluvial processes. Streamflow regime exerts
              selective pressures on riparian vegetation, resulting in
              adaptations (trait syndromes) to specific flow attributes.
              Widespread modification of flow regimes by humans has resulted in
              extensive alteration of riparian vegetation communities. Some of
              the negative effects of altered flow regimes on vegetation may be
              reversed by restoring components of the natural flow regime. 2.
              Models have been developed that quantitatively relate components
              of the flow regime to attributes of riparian vegetation at the
              individual, population and community levels. Predictive models
              range from simple statistical relationships, to more complex
              stochastic matrix population models and dynamic simulation
              models. Of the dozens of predictive models reviewed here, most
              treat one or a few species, have many simplifying assumptions
              such as stable channel form, and do not specify the time-scale of
              response. In many cases, these models are very effective in
              developing alternative streamflow management plans for specific
              river reaches or segments but are not directly transferable to
              other rivers or other regions. 3. A primary goal in riparian
              ecology is to develop general frameworks for prediction of
              vegetation response to changing environmental conditions. The
              development of riparian vegetation-flow response guilds offers a
              framework for transferring information from rivers where flow
              standards have been developed to maintain desirable vegetation
              attributes, to rivers with little or no existing information. 4.
              We propose to organise riparian plants into non-phylogenetic
              groupings of species with shared traits that are related to
              components of hydrologic regime: life history, reproductive
              strategy, morphology, adaptations to fluvial disturbance and
              adaptations to water availability. Plants from any river or
              region may be grouped into these guilds and related to hydrologic
              attributes of a specific class of river using probabilistic
              response curves. 5. Probabilistic models based on riparian
              response guilds enable prediction of the likelihood of change in
              each of the response guilds given projected changes in flow, and
              facilitate examination of trade-offs and risks associated with
              various flow management strategies. Riparian response guilds can
              be decomposed to the species level for individual projects or
              used to develop flow management guidelines for regional water
              management plans.",
