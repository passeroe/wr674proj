# Probability of Occurrence of Riparian Vegetation Guilds by Flow Scenario

## Initialize variables
```{r inputs, message=FALSE}
# This is where users will put in the % flow reduction, withdrawal, median enforcement, or specify a scenario like flow reduction with climate change

enforce_med <- "No"
per_red <- 0.20 # percent flow reduction set to 0 if adding withdrawal
median_q <- 160 # median flow value - could use monthly or annual
withdrawal <- 0 # set to 0 if doing percent flow reduction
guild_list <- list("guild1", "guild2", "guild3")

# read in historical flow record
historic_q <- readr::read_csv("Cherry_Braid_hydrograph.csv",col_names = TRUE)
ep_zone_pref <- readr::read_csv("guild_by_ep.csv",col_names = TRUE)
inun_q_map <- read_stars("inunQmap.tif")
```

## Build Flow Scenario
```{r flow_scene}
source("flow.scenario.R")
flow_scene <- flow.scenario(historic_q,enforce_med,median_q,withdrawal,per_red)

```

## Calculate EP for Flow Scenario
```{r}


```
